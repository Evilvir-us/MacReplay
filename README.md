# **MacSurge**

MacSurge is a modified version of [STB-Proxy](https://github.com/Chris230291/STB-Proxy), designed for connectivity between MAC address portals and media platforms like Plex or M3U-based software.  

This lightweight solution eliminates the need for Docker by compiling everything into a single executable file, making it easy to use and deploy on Windows systems.
