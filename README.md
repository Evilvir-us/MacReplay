## Troubleshooting

If the TV guide is not being populated:
Check the [XMLTV guide](http://192.168.1.88:8001/xmltv).
If it is just the list of channels with nothing below them, the provider likely does not supply a guide.
Try switching to a different provider.

## **Known Issues**

Channel logos may not display when viewed in a browser. This is likely due to your browsers security, related to HTTP files being served on an HTTPS domain.\

This issue does not occur with [PLEX HTPC](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFFF6NN1LZDQ?ocid=pdpshare), the mobile apps, or the TV app. To watch from a PC, use [PLEX HTPC](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFFF6NN1LZDQ?ocid=pdpshare). If any logos are still missing, it means the provider isn't supplying them.
